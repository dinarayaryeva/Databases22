  We have a computer system where each computer has a unique model and cost. This computer can be either laptop or desktop. We have to store a weight for laptop and overall perfomance measured for desktop computer. Laptop can have different memory options, whereas desktop can vary components like memory, sound card and video card, which are distinct. Each component is identified by serial number and has manufacturer name on it. It is crutial to save information about the size of memory and vidoe card components as well as type of sound card.
  Computer can be sold with different accessory. Accesories will be defined by unique model and type of connector. Some of accesories can be like mouse or keyboard or monitor. It should be possible to store language supported for keyboard and dysplay size for monitor. Also wireless and non-wireless mice should be distinguished.
  Moreover, there is the software that can be installed on the computer. SOftware should have a unique name, version and date of last update. One of possible software is the operating system, for which we can identify a family(like unix, windows etc). Be carefull, there is a dependency between a component in hardware and a software. Component should support it.
